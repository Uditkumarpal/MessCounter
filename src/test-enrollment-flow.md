# Testing Student Enrollment and Billing Flow

## Test Scenario 1: New Student Enrollment

1. **Student Registration**
   - Student registers with a mess
   - System automatically sets enrollment date to current date
   - Student is added to the mess

2. **Billing Delay**
   - Billing should not start immediately
   - Billing should start from the next month after enrollment

3. **Admin View**
   - Admin should see student in enrollment tracking
   - Student should show as "Waiting" status until next month
   - Admin should only see students from their own mess

## Test Scenario 2: Bill Generation

1. **Before Next Month**
   - Generate bills for current month
   - Student enrolled this month should NOT appear in bills

2. **After Next Month**
   - Generate bills for next month
   - Student should now appear in bills
   - Only students from admin's mess should appear

## Test Scenario 3: Multi-Mess Isolation

1. **Different Admins**
   - Admin A should only see students from Mess A
   - Admin B should only see students from Mess B
   - No cross-contamination of student data
